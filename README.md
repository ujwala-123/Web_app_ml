# Iris Flower Species Web Application using Django Framework

In this project, I have created a web application using the Django framework that leverages machine learning to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. By integrating a pre-trained model with Django's user-friendly interface, I have developed a platform where I can easily input the measurements of an iris flower and obtain an accurate prediction for its species. This application showcases the seamless integration of Django and machine learning, providing me with a convenient and efficient tool to identify the species of iris flowers based on their physical attributes.
